What are the numbers?
</H3>

Each number corresponds with the time the ball spends in the air.
For example, a 5 throw will be thrown again 5 beats later, a 4 throw will be thrown again 4 beats later.  The numbers are called <i>siteswaps</i>.
<BR>
<BR>
To juggle three balls in the cascade pattern (the simplest 3 ball pattern) each ball is thrown every three beats (allowing for two throws in the mean time).  Therefore the pattern is given by "3".
<BR>

<BR>
Even numbers land in the same hand, and odd numbers will land in the other hand.
<BR>
<BR>

The number of beats is the number of numbers which describe the pattern.
For example, the pattern "441" has three beats, the pattern "3" has one beat.
